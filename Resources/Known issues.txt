Known issues

At first run and after changing orientation, iPhone shows detail view controller. I have tried disable it by using UISplitViewControllerDelegate and setting preferredDisplayMode to .allVisible and other tricks, but nothing worked.

Navigating to detail view controller does not work on iPhone in portrait mode
